Part 1

- It originally took around 200 seconds for the poor performance script to run
- I then ran a c profile to see which steps were taking the longest
- I then noticed that it was the list comprehensions that were taking the longest
- I then analyzed the existing script and noticed that the list comprehensions were redundant
- I then modified the function to only run one list comprehension which slowed it down (but not fast enough)
- I then created a function within the funtion to execute the list comprehension and it reduced the time to 1 sec (sys time)

Part 2

- I analyzed alice's file and noticed that it had two main parts
- The first part is the timer (which she used to time her functions)
- The second part is a class with an initialization and call
- I then took the second part and incorporated it into the original alice.py script
- This also reduced the sys time to 1 sec
- The caller helps optimize the performance of the script by having an instance behave like a function
